### Requirements: Caffe

Requirements for `Caffe` and `matcaffe` (see: [Caffe installation instructions](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html))

### Installation
1. Build Caffe and matcaffe
    ```Shell
    cd $Re-ranking_ROOT/caffe
    # Now follow the Caffe installation instructions here:
    # http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html
    make -j8 && make matcaffe
    ```
    
2. Download pre-computed imagenet models, Market-1501 dataset and CUHK03 dataset
  ```Shell
  Please download the pre-trained imagenet models and put it in the "data/imagenet_models" folder.
  Please download Market-1501 dataset and unzip it in the "evaluation/data/Market-1501" folder. 
  Please download CUHK03 dataset and unzip it in the "evaluation/data/CUHK03" folder.
  ```

- [CUHK03](https://pan.baidu.com/----)

### Training and testing IDE model with our re-ranking method

1. Training 
  ```Shell
  cd $Re-ranking_ROOT
  # train IDE ResNet_50 for Market-1501
  ./experiments/Market-1501/train_IDE_ResNet_50.sh
  
  # train IDE ResNet_50 for CUHK03
  ./experiments/CUHK03/train_IDE_ResNet_50_labeled.sh
  ./experiments/CUHK03/train_IDE_ResNet_50_detected.sh
  ```
2. Feature Extraction
  ```Shell
  cd $Re-ranking_ROOT/evaluation
  # extract feature for Market-1501
  matlab Market_1501_extract_feature.m
  
  # extract feature for CUHK03
  matlab CUHK03_extract_feature.m
  ```
  
3. Evaluation with our re-ranking method
  ```Shell
    # evaluation for Market-1501
    matlab Market_1501_evaluation.m
    
    # evaluation for CUHK03
    matlab CUHK03_evaluation.m
  ``` 
  
### Results
You can download our pre-trained IDE models and IDE features, and put them in the "out_put"  and "evaluation/feat" folder, respectively.

- [IDE features](https://pan.baidu.com/123)

Using the above IDE models and IDE features, you can reproduce the results with our re-ranking as follows:

- Market-1501

|Methods | Â  Rank@1 | mAP|
| --------   | -----  | ----  |
|IDE_ResNet_50  + Euclidean | 78.92% | 55.03%|
|IDE_ResNet_50  + Euclidean + re-ranking | 81.44% | 70.39%|
|IDE_ResNet_50  + XQDA      | 77.58% | 56.06%|
|IDE_ResNet_50  + XQDA +re-ranking     | 80.70% | 69.98%|
